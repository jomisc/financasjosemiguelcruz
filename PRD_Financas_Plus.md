# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Finanças+ - Personal Finance Management App

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Finanças+ is a free, user-friendly personal finance management web application that enables users to track income, expenses, and budgets across multiple categories. Unlike competitors charging €99-€114/year (YNAB), Finanças+ provides essential budget management features at no cost, addressing the growing demand from financially-conscious consumers who find existing premium solutions prohibitively expensive.

## 2. Narrative

**Maria's Story:**

Maria is a 28-year-old marketing professional living in Lisbon. Every month, she starts with good intentions—planning to save for a future trip to Japan. But by mid-month, she loses track of her spending. A coffee here, dinner with friends there, and suddenly she's checking her bank balance with anxiety, unsure where her money went.

She tried YNAB, but at €114/year, the subscription felt like yet another expense she couldn't justify. She needed something simpler—a way to categorize her spending, set monthly budgets, and see at a glance if she's on track for her savings goals.

With Finanças+, Maria opens the app each morning over coffee. She sees her budget dashboard: €800 allocated for groceries (€320 spent so far), €200 for entertainment (€145 remaining). A quick glance tells her she can say yes to Friday's concert without guilt. By month-end, she's saved €250—her Japan fund is growing, and for the first time in years, she feels in control.

## 3. Goals Framework

### Business Goals
- **Market Entry:** Capture 0.5% of the personal finance app market (targeting 10,000 active users) within 12 months of launch
- **User Engagement:** Achieve 60% monthly active user retention rate
- **Competitive Positioning:** Establish Finanças+ as the leading free alternative to YNAB and MoneyWiz in Portuguese-speaking markets
- **Revenue Potential:** Build foundation for future premium features (Phase 2: multi-currency, investment tracking) with freemium model

### User Goals
- **Budget Control:** Enable users to set monthly budgets by category and track spending in real-time
- **Financial Visibility:** Provide instant clarity on remaining budget, spending patterns, and savings progress
- **Stress Reduction:** Eliminate the anxiety of not knowing "where the money went" each month
- **Savings Achievement:** Help users consistently meet savings goals for retirement, trips, emergencies, and major purchases
- **Accessibility:** Deliver professional-grade budget management without subscription fees

### Non-Goals
- **Investment Portfolio Management:** Not building stock/crypto tracking (future consideration)
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Launch focuses on single-currency accounts (EUR) only
- **Bank Integration:** No automatic transaction imports via Open Banking APIs (manual entry only for MVP)
- **Bill Payment:** Not processing actual payments—tracking only

- **Mobile Native Apps:** Web-only at launch; native iOS/Android apps deferred to Phase 2

## 4. Validation & Strategic Rationale

### A. WHY THIS MATTERS

#### Customer Impact:
- **Daily Stress:** 72% of young adults report taking action to improve financial health due to higher living costs, with budget uncertainty causing significant daily anxiety (Bank of America, 2025)
- **Consequences of Inaction:** Without budget tracking, users overspend by average of 15-20% monthly, fail to build emergency funds, and experience relationship stress from money arguments
- **Most Affected Segments:**
  - Millennials (28-43) and Gen Z (18-27) facing stagnant wages, high cost of living, and student debt
  - Young professionals earning €25,000-€45,000/year who want to save but lack visibility into spending
  - Anyone preparing for major life goals: home purchase, wedding, parental retirement support, travel

#### Business Impact:
- **Market Size:** Global personal finance app market projected to reach $330 billion by 2028 (Globe Newswire, 2024)
- **Growth Rate:** 15.3% CAGR through 2033 (Straits Research)
- **Economic Impact:** Financial stress costs businesses $250B+ annually in lost productivity; personal finance apps reduce this by improving employee financial wellness
- **Revenue Opportunity:** Top budgeting apps (Intuit, Acorns) generate $100M+ annually; even 0.1% market share represents significant opportunity with freemium monetization

### B. EVIDENCE & PROOF

#### Customer Pain Points (Real Feedback):

**YNAB Complaints:**
- "YNAB is too expensive at $99/year—I'm trying to save money, not spend more on a budgeting app!" (Reddit r/personalfinance, 2024)
- "The learning curve is ridiculous. I gave up after 3 weeks because it was more work than my actual job." (Trustpilot, 5% gave 1-2 stars)
- "Why do I need to pay a subscription forever? I just want to track my spending, not mortgage my future." (Vox, 2024)

**MoneyWiz User Feedback:**
- "App crashes frequently, losing my transaction data." (JustUseApp Reviews)
- "Sync issues mean I can't trust the numbers I'm seeing." (App Store Reviews, 4.6/5 but 100% negative sentiment on specific features)

**General Market Sentiment:**
- "I went back to Excel spreadsheets because every good app wants $10-15/month." (Bogleheads Forum)
- "Mint was free and perfect—now it's gone and everything costs money." (Multiple Reddit threads, 2024)
- "I need something between a simple spreadsheet and an overly complicated enterprise tool." (Quora finance discussions)

#### Social Proof:
- Financial therapists note budgeting apps can cause harm when overcomplicated, increasing anxiety rather than reducing it (Business Insider, 2024)
- Millennials actually outpace older generations in savings rates when given proper tools (Investopedia study)
- 63% of Americans state inflation prevented them from saving—indicating massive need for budget visibility tools (Bankrate)

### C. STRATEGIC CONTEXT

#### Why Now?
1. **Post-Mint Vacuum:** Intuit shut down free Mint app in 2024, leaving millions seeking free alternatives (Bogleheads discussions show active replacement-seeking behavior)
2. **Subscription Fatigue:** Consumers increasingly resistant to "yet another subscription"—45% actively cutting subscriptions in 2024
3. **Economic Pressure:** Inflation and cost-of-living crisis makes budget tools essential, not optional
4. **Technology Maturity:** Modern web frameworks (React, Supabase) make building robust financial apps accessible at low cost

#### Market Trends:
- **Shift to Freemium:** Successful apps offer robust free tiers to build user base, monetize through premium features
- **Simplification Movement:** Users rejecting overly complex enterprise tools in favor of "does one thing well" focused apps
- **Financial Wellness Priority:** Employers and individuals prioritizing mental health tied to financial security
- **European Market Growth:** Portuguese/European market underserved compared to US-focused solutions

   - "Why do I have to pay $100/year to save money?" (Reddit, 350+ upvotes)
   - No strong free option after Mint shutdown
   - **Gap:** Free, no-compromise core budgeting features

2. **Simplicity:**
   - "YNAB takes a PhD to understand" (common complaint)
   - Feature bloat: investment tracking, debt payoff calculators users don't need
   - **Gap:** Does core budgeting exceptionally well, nothing more

3. **European Market:**
   - Most apps US-centric (USD, US banks, US terminology)
   - Portuguese language support minimal
   - **Gap:** Europe-first design with proper localization

4. **Trust & Privacy:**

2. **Delightfully Simple:** Setup in 5 minutes, intuitive interface, no manual required
3. **No Bank Connection Needed:** Manual entry = full privacy + works with any bank globally
4. **Portuguese-First:** Built for European users with EUR support, local terminology, Portuguese interface
5. **Export Everything:** Download your data anytime as CSV—no vendor lock-in
6. **Future Freemium:** Clear premium path (multi-currency, advanced analytics) for when users want more—start free, upgrade when it makes sense

**Why Customers Will Switch:**

- From YNAB: "Same core features, €99/year savings, simpler to use"
- From Spreadsheets: "Finally automatic calculations and mobile access without Excel complexity"
- From Nothing: "Free, takes 2 minutes daily, shows exactly where money goes"
- From Banking Apps: "Finally can plan ahead, not just react to my balance"
